# ZeroEPUB
A good EPUB reader application for Windows and Linux.

## Currently on hiatus, sorry.

Made with the Avalonia UI framework.

If you stumbled across this, hello. You can clone and help.

Requirements:
* VS Code
* Avalonia UI Extension
* .NET 8.0 Core. 7.0 might be needed also.
* A sample EPUB book to open. Crime And Punishment is a book that's public domain and availiable to [download](http://bbebooksthailand.com/phpscripts/bbdownload.php?ebookdownload=CrimePunishment-EPUB2). Thats the EPUB file I use to test it.

## Currently being made. Releases aren't available.
